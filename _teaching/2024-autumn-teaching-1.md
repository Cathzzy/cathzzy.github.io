Course Description
======
Linear regression analysis is a collection of statistical techniques used in many areas of behavior and brain science. The basic techniques in linear and multiple regression provide the basic foundation for more advanced methods such as structural equation modeling, factor analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course designed to provide a conceptually oriented introduction to bivariate and multivariate linear regression. It is centered on the application of regression methods to behavioral data, and it extends to research involving categorical variables, assessing the suitability of regression methods, and variable selection techniques. Practical exercises will use software and computation tools such as R/Rstudio. The course follows a course in fundamantal statistics methods and assumes a basic knowledge of univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing.
